00:00:04.560 --> 00:00:09.220
Welcome to this course on LaTeX for Students, Engineers and Scientists.

2
00:00:09.860 --> 00:00:12.820
I am Firuza Karmali, one of the course instructors.

3
00:00:13.600 --> 00:00:17.560
So we will look at the following things in this session-

4
00:00:17.760 --> 00:00:21.820
what is LaTeX, when and why people use it, what can you do in LaTeX,

5
00:00:21.980 --> 00:00:26.220
and we will show some sample documents which have been created using LaTeX.

6
00:00:28.220 --> 00:00:34.560
So let's get an overview. LaTeX was written by Leslie Lamport in the early 1980s.

7
00:00:35.260 --> 00:00:40.840
LaTeX is a document preparation system which is released under LaTeX Project Public License.

8
00:00:41.560 --> 00:00:47.940
So you can consider, it is an alternative to an editing software like Microsoft Word, Libre Writer.

9
00:00:48.640 --> 00:00:54.560
If you want more information about the LaTeX project, please visit the website: www.latex-project.org.

10
00:00:56.840 --> 00:01:03.420
So what is not LaTeX? LaTeX is not WYSIWYG. WYSIWYG is- what you see is what you get.

11
00:01:04.820 --> 00:01:10.300
So a writer just writes some basic simple markup commands for formatting.

12
00:01:10.620 --> 00:01:14.820
He just concentrates on the content and not on the formatting

13
00:01:15.200 --> 00:01:19.500
and you can write complex mathematical formulas with ease.

14
00:01:20.060 --> 00:01:27.380
So what can be done? One can write articles, books, journals, papers, posters, banners, you name it and you can write it.

15
00:01:27.920 --> 00:01:33.380
So why it is so easy that people use it? Now consider that a person is writing a book.

16
00:01:33.700 --> 00:01:39.660
So while a person writes a book, it is a practise to start a chapter from the odd page

17
00:01:39.780 --> 00:01:41.520
and not from the even page.

18
00:01:41.620 --> 00:01:46.780
So in a normal text editor, one needs to manually set this for each chapter.

19
00:01:46.980 --> 00:01:52.980
What if a person writes more content in the previous chapters? The chapters would get shifted.

20
00:01:53.780 --> 00:02:00.200
But LaTeX does this for you, automatically. You write a chapter, it will always begin from an odd page.

21
00:02:02.200 --> 00:02:07.680
So now let's come to process of writing. So just choose your favourite text editor,

22
00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:11.760
write the commands, save it as a .tex file.

23
00:02:12.380 --> 00:02:17.740
We build it by running this command 'pdflatex (Your file name).tex'

24
00:02:17.940 --> 00:02:24.460
or there are build options right from the LaTeX IDEs, and which will generate a pdf file.

25
00:02:25.480 --> 00:02:34.380
Now let us see some sample documents. This was a manual created for one of our programming courses

26
00:02:34.700 --> 00:02:38.000
in 2014, which was done in LaTeX.

27
00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:47.340
If you see, this title page is so well typeset. It's centred, some of the titles are bold,

28
00:02:47.620 --> 00:02:54.740
there is a logo, it's equally spaced, you can see something else, there is a hyperlink,

29
00:02:54.820 --> 00:02:58.600
there are page numbers, these are the table of contents.

30
00:02:58.780 --> 00:03:02.660
I can click on this particular section which I want to go to,

31
00:03:02.660 --> 00:03:04.740
I have list of figures which we have used,

32
00:03:05.060 --> 00:03:10.160
I have list of tables, there are some sections, subsections,

33
00:03:10.360 --> 00:03:15.140
these are enumerate points, tables, figures.

34
00:03:15.860 --> 00:03:23.140
If you see this particular page number 9 is in landscape format. This is yet to be written.

35
00:03:23.640 --> 00:03:30.320
Some diagrams are there. It's very well typeset if you see the margins etc., the font,

36
00:03:30.540 --> 00:03:34.520
it looks uniform. People will say, "Ah, what a document".

37
00:03:35.560 --> 00:03:43.120
Now let's go back and see a poster. This is also created in LaTeX using one of the classes.

38
00:03:43.300 --> 00:03:48.740
If you see, there is introduction, there are diagrams, there are references, conclusion,

39
00:03:48.920 --> 00:03:51.460
all of which look so neat and tidy.

40
00:03:52.500 --> 00:03:53.740
Now let's see a document.

41
00:03:54.200 --> 00:03:58.960
One of the objectives of this course, is to achieve a typesetting shown in this document.

42
00:03:59.440 --> 00:04:06.440
So we start by writing plain text i.e. without LaTeX code and build upon it, session by session.

43
00:04:06.900 --> 00:04:14.800
The enhanced article unit under each session will highlight what LaTeX commands were added to typeset the document,

44
00:04:15.080 --> 00:04:17.720
and move one step closer to the final one.

45
00:04:18.280 --> 00:04:19.660
This is the title page

46
00:04:22.600 --> 00:04:31.920
Preface with some text colored in pink and green, some citations, cross-referencing to respective chapters and sections

47
00:04:34.520 --> 00:04:41.820
A clickable Table of contents, list of tables, and list of figures.

48
00:04:44.100 --> 00:04:53.860
If you see this is a chapter 1- Phenomena, which is typeset in double spacing having bullet items, hyperlinks, and a footnote.

49
00:04:57.080 --> 00:05:03.600
Chapter 2 also has some citations, an image, and mathematical formulas.

50
00:05:07.260 --> 00:05:11.760
Chapter 3, also has a table where some rows and columns are merged.

51
00:05:13.500 --> 00:05:17.300
The Section 3.3 is typeset into two columns.

52
00:05:21.020 --> 00:05:24.220
Section 3.6 is in landscape mode.

53
00:05:24.420 --> 00:05:28.740
Finally coming to our bibliography and back index.

54
00:05:29.760 --> 00:05:33.080
Now let us see a book which was created using LaTeX.

55
00:05:34.480 --> 00:05:38.700
This book was created for one of our summer internship projects.

56
00:05:42.280 --> 00:05:46.620
So this contains the list of interns, list of mentors

57
00:05:52.660 --> 00:06:00.300
and it has the date, attendees, absentees, number, issue, assigned to, etc.

58
00:06:00.460 --> 00:06:06.720
So, which we can maintain to record our minutes of the meetings that we used to have for our project.

59
00:06:07.680 --> 00:06:13.340
So these are the things that was done.

60
00:06:13.860 --> 00:06:17.780
So in this session, we learnt what is LaTeX,

61
00:06:18.060 --> 00:06:21.780
we saw the different documents that can be created using LaTeX.

62
00:06:22.320 --> 00:06:23.780
Thank you. Have a nice day.
